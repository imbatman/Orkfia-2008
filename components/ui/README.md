Purpose: UI component library (shadcn/ui based)

This folder will contain reusable UI primitives and composed components used across the app.

Guidelines:
- Prefer server components for static content; client components when interactivity is needed.
- Keep styling with Tailwind CSS; encapsulate complex patterns into components.
- Export via index.ts where appropriate.
